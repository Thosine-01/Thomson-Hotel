view.py is the file that contain Python functions or classes that handle web requests and return web responses. They are a crucial part of Django's Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture, acting as the bridge between your application's data (managed by models) and its presentation (handled by templates).

Here's a breakdown of their primary uses:
1. Request Handling:
Views receive incoming HTTP requests (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) from users and process them.

2. Business Logic:
- They encapsulate the core logic of your application, such as: 
- Querying the database to retrieve or store data using Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapper).
- Processing user input from forms.
- Performing calculations or other data manipulations.

3. Response Generation:
-Views are responsible for generating and returning an appropriate web response to the client. This can be:
{
    Rendered HTML content using Django templates.
    A redirect to another URL.
    A 404 error page.
    An API response (e.g., JSON or XML).
}

4. Connecting Models and Templates:
-Views fetch data from your Django models and pass it to the templates for display, effectively orchestrating the flow of information within your application.


In essence, views.py is where you define how your Django application responds to different user interactions and generates the content that users see.

for my booking app view page will contain
    - Request to be handled
    {
        request to GET the rooms
        requst to GET room types
        requst to GET features
        request to POST some of the quest information
        request to POST bookinks
    }

    -Business Logic
    {
        
    }
